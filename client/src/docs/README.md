# First Million: Supabase Auth Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of Supabase authentication in the First Million web app.

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Supabase Client Configuration**
   - Created `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` for Supabase client setup and auth functions

2. **Authentication Hook**
   - Created `client/src/hooks/useSupabaseAuth.ts` for managing authentication state

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - Created `client/src/lib/syncService.ts` for syncing local data with Supabase

4. **Auth Components**
   - Created `client/src/components/auth/auth-form.tsx` as a reusable auth form
   - Created `client/src/components/auth/login-modal.tsx` for dashboard login

5. **Onboarding Flow Updates**
   - Modified `client/src/components/onboarding/onboarding-flow.tsx` to replace the salary step with login/signup
   - Added "Skip" option for authentication

6. **Dashboard Updates**
   - Updated `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` to add login option from dashboard
   - Added auth status indicators and buttons

7. **App Integration**
   - Updated `client/src/App.tsx` to handle authentication state and data synchronization

8. **Database Schema**
   - Created `client/src/supabase-schema.sql` with SQL queries for database setup
   - Added Row Level Security (RLS) policies to protect user data

9. **Documentation**
   - Created `client/src/docs/supabase-setup.md` with setup instructions

## Steps to Complete Setup

1. **Supabase Project Creation**
   - Create a Supabase account at [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project and note your project URL and anon key

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory with the following variables:
     ```
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase project
   - Run the SQL commands in `client/src/supabase-schema.sql`

4. **Authentication Settings**
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Settings
   - Configure Email auth provider settings
   - Set up redirect URLs for email confirmations

5. **Testing**
   - Run the application and test the new authentication flow
   - Verify that data is synced between local storage and Supabase

## Key Features

1. **Dual Storage Strategy**
   - Data is stored both locally and in Supabase
   - Users can work offline and sync when they sign in

2. **Skip Option**
   - Users can skip authentication during onboarding
   - They can sign in later from the dashboard

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - When a user signs in, local data is synced to Supabase
   - Future improvements could include bidirectional sync

## SQL Schema Details

The Supabase database includes the following tables:

1. **users** - Extended user profile information
2. **categories** - Income and expense categories
3. **transactions** - Financial transactions
4. **investments** - Investment records
5. **goals** - Financial goals
6. **assets** - User asset records

Each table has Row Level Security (RLS) policies that ensure users can only access their own data.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bidirectional Sync** - Improve the sync mechanism to merge local and cloud data
2. **Social Auth** - Add Google, Facebook, and other social login options
3. **Multi-device Support** - Enhanced support for using the app across multiple devices
4. **Offline Mode Improvements** - Better handling of offline/online transitions
